# Stain - VS Code Extension

## Overview
When working with large code files, it's easy to lose track of where you were. **Stain** solves this by letting you highlight important lines so you can quickly find them later.

## Features
- Mark any line with a **green stain** for quick reference.
- Locate stained lines using the **scroll bar**.
- Click on a stained mark in the scroll bar to **jump back** to that line.
- **Easily remove stains** by right-clicking and selecting "Unstain".
- **Use a keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Y`)** to toggle staining on and off.

## How to Use

### Staining a Line
1. Right-click on any line and select **"Stain Line"**.
2. The line will be highlighted with a green stain.
3. The stain will also be visible in the **scroll bar** for easy navigation.

### Unstaining a Line
1. Right-click on a stained line and select **"Unstain Line"**.
2. The highlight will be removed.

### Using Keyboard Shortcuts
- Press **`Ctrl+Y`** to stain an unstained line.
- Press **`Ctrl+Y`** again to remove the stain from a stained line.
- The shortcut is context-aware, meaning it will **toggle** the stain.

## Configuration
No additional configuration is requiredâ€”just install and start marking lines!

## Why Use Stain?
- No more **losing track** of your code position.
- Quickly **jump back** to important lines.
