# Stain - VS Code Extension

## Overview
When working with large code files, it's easy to lose track of where you were. **Stain** solves this by letting you highlight important lines so you can quickly find them later.

## Features
- Mark any line with a **green stain** for quick reference.
- Locate stained lines using the **scroll bar**.
- Click on a stained mark in the scroll bar to **jump back** to that line.
- **Easily remove stains** by right-clicking and selecting "Unstain".
- **Use a keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Y`)** to toggle staining on and off.

## How to Use

### Staining a Line
